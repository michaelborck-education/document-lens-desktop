---

## Quick Start

### 1. Create a Project
- Click **"New Project"** on the home screen
- Enter project name (e.g., "2024 Annual Reports")
- **Choose a Research Theme** — this determines which keyword frameworks are available:
  - **Sustainability**: TCFD, GRI, SDGs, SASB frameworks
  - **Cybersecurity**: NIST CSF, ISO 27001, CIS Controls, MITRE ATT&CK
  - **Finance**: Financial Ratios, SEC Regulations, Basel III, Risk Metrics
  - **Healthcare**: Clinical Trials, FDA Regulations, HIPAA, Medical Terms
  - **Legal**: Contract Terms, Regulatory Language, Compliance Keywords
  - **Academic**: Research Methods, Statistical Terms, Literature Review
  - **Project Management**: Agile/Scrum, PMBOK, Risk Management
  - **General**: Start with custom keywords only
- Click **Create**

### 2. Import Documents (PDFs)
- Inside your project, click **"Import PDFs"** or drag files into the drop zone
- Alternatively, click **"Add from Library"** to use documents already in your library
- App automatically extracts text and stores metadata
- Documents appear in the project dashboard

### 3. Start Analyzing
- Click **"Keyword Search"** to find framework keywords
- Click **"Visualizations"** to see keyword frequency
- Click **"N-gram Analysis"** to find common phrases
- Use **Quick Filter** on any analysis page to focus on specific documents

## Core Concepts

### Document Library
**What**: A central repository of all PDFs you've imported into Document Lens.

**Why**: Documents can be reused across multiple projects without duplicating files. Import once, use everywhere.

**Key Points**:
- Access via **"Document Library"** from the home screen
- One document can belong to multiple projects
- Delete from library removes from all projects
- Remove from project keeps document in library

### Projects
**What**: Organizational containers for grouping related documents together.

**Why**: Separate different research efforts, time periods, or research domains.

**Key Points**:
- Each project has a **Research Theme** that determines available keyword frameworks
- Choose from 8 themes: Sustainability, Cybersecurity, Finance, Healthcare, Legal, Academic, Project Management, or General

**Examples**:
- "2024 Climate Reports" (Sustainability theme)
- "Security Audit Q1" (Cybersecurity theme)
- "Contract Review 2024" (Legal theme)

### Quick Filter
**What**: Ad-hoc filtering on analysis pages to include/exclude specific documents.

**Why**: Analyze any subset of your project's documents without creating separate projects.

**Use Cases**:
- Compare just 3 specific companies
- Analyze only documents from 2023
- Focus on documents that mention certain topics

### Analysis Profiles
**What**: Saved sets of keyword searches and domain settings for repeated analysis.

**Why**: Reuse the same analysis configuration across different projects.

**Examples**:
- "TCFD Climate Risks" - TCFD keywords + climate domain focus
- "SDG Mapping" - SDG keywords + all domains
- "Board Governance" - SASB governance keywords + governance domain

### Choosing a Theme

When creating a new project, you'll see the theme selector:

1. Click **New Project**
2. Enter your project name
3. Click a theme card to select it
4. Read the description to confirm it matches your needs
5. Click **Create**

### Switching Themes

Themes are set when you create a project. To use a different theme:
1. Create a new project with the desired theme
2. Use **Add from Library** to add your existing documents to the new project

### Using Multiple Themes

If your research spans multiple domains (e.g., healthcare finance), you can:
1. Create separate projects for each theme
2. Add the same documents to both projects
3. Analyze with domain-specific frameworks in each

## Quick Filter

### What Is Quick Filter?

Quick Filter lets you analyze a subset of documents without modifying your project. Available on:
- Visualizations page
- N-gram Analysis page

### Using Quick Filter

1. Navigate to **Visualizations** or **N-gram Analysis**
2. Click the **filter dropdown** (shows "All Documents" by default)
3. Select **"Select specific documents..."**
4. In the dialog, check the documents you want to include
5. Click **Apply Filter**
6. Analysis re-runs with only selected documents

### Quick Filter vs Projects

| Feature | Quick Filter | Projects |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| Scope | Temporary, per-session | Permanent organization |
| Storage | Not saved | Saved to database |
| Use case | Ad-hoc exploration | Ongoing research |
| Sharing | Not exportable | Exportable in bundles |

### When to Use Quick Filter

**Good for:**
- "Let me just check these 3 documents quickly"
- "What if I exclude the outlier company?"
- "Compare documents from a single year"

**Better as a Project:**
- Repeated analysis on same subset
- Need to share with colleagues
- Part of your research methodology

- **No data loss**: Your projects, documents, and settings are preserved
- **Release notes**: Visit GitHub Releases to see what's new in each version

### Troubleshooting Updates

**Update notification doesn't appear**
- Updates only work in the installed app (not during development)
- Check your internet connection
- Try restarting the app

**Download seems stuck**
- Large updates may take time on slow connections
- Progress shows in the notification
- You can continue working while it downloads

**Update fails to install**
- Restart the app and try again
- Download the latest version manually from GitHub Releases
- Check disk space (updates need temporary space)

## Tips & Best Practices

### Organization
- Use meaningful project names
- Add metadata to documents (company, year) for better filtering
- Use Quick Filter for ad-hoc analysis, projects for permanent organization

### Performance
- Large projects (1000+ documents) may be slower
- Use Quick Filter to subset documents during analysis
- Disable unused domains in profiles to speed up analysis

### Quality
- Start with small dataset to test your workflow
- Verify results manually (keyword search shows context)
- Document your methodology for reproducibility

### Collaboration
- Always export with profiles included
- Use metadata (company, year, country) consistently
- Version your bundles (v1, v2) when sharing updates

---

## Troubleshooting

### Search Returns No Results
**Problem**: Keywords don't match documents

**Possible causes**:
1. Keywords not actually in documents (manually review)
2. Profile has wrong keywords selected

**Solution**:
1. View original PDF to verify content
2. Edit profile to include relevant keywords

### Slow Performance
**Problem**: Analysis taking too long

**Solution**:
1. Reduce document count with Quick Filter
2. Disable unused domains in profile
3. Run analysis in smaller batches

### Document Stats Not Available
**Problem**: "View Stats" shows no analysis

**Solution**:
1. Run analysis first: Analysis → Run Analysis
2. Wait for analysis to complete
3. Stats now available
