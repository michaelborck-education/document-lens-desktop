# Keyword List Methodology

This document describes how the keyword lists in Document Lens were created. Understanding this methodology is important for researchers who need to cite or reproduce their analysis.

## Overview

Document Lens provides two types of keyword lists for each research theme:

1. **Framework-Based Keywords**: Terms derived from established standards and frameworks (e.g., TCFD, NIST CSF, PMBOK)
2. **General Domain Keywords**: Common terminology used in the field without framework-specific constraints

## Creation Process

### Tools Used

The keyword lists were created using a hybrid approach:

- **Large Language Model (LLM)**: Claude (Anthropic) was used to generate initial keyword lists based on framework documentation and domain knowledge
- **Human Review**: All lists were reviewed and validated against official framework documentation
- **Iterative Refinement**: Keywords were organized into logical categories aligned with framework structures

### Framework-Based Keywords

For each framework, keywords were derived from:

1. **Official Documentation**: Primary source documents from framework publishers
2. **Framework Structure**: Keywords organized to match the framework's official structure (e.g., TCFD's four pillars, NIST CSF's five functions)
3. **Implementation Guidance**: Supplementary materials and implementation guides
4. **Common Usage**: Terms frequently used by practitioners implementing the framework

### General Domain Keywords

General domain keyword lists were created to provide:

- **Flexibility**: For documents that don't follow specific frameworks
- **Exploratory Analysis**: For initial document exploration before framework selection
- **Broader Coverage**: Common industry terminology beyond formal frameworks

These lists include:
- Fundamental domain concepts
- Common industry terminology
- Practitioner language
- Cross-cutting themes

## Keyword Categories

Keywords are organized into logical categories that reflect:

1. **Framework Structure**: For framework-based lists, categories match official framework components
2. **Functional Areas**: For general lists, categories represent major functional domains
3. **Concept Groupings**: Related terms are grouped for easier selection

## Keyword Selection Criteria

Keywords were selected based on:

1. **Relevance**: Direct relevance to the framework or domain
2. **Frequency**: Terms commonly appearing in relevant documents
3. **Specificity**: Balance between specific technical terms and broader concepts
4. **Distinctiveness**: Terms that indicate discussion of the topic (avoiding overly common words)

## Limitations

Researchers should be aware of:

1. **LLM Generation**: Initial lists were generated by an LLM, which may introduce biases or gaps
2. **English Only**: Keywords are in English; translations may not capture all nuances
3. **Point in Time**: Framework terminology evolves; lists reflect standards as of creation date
4. **Coverage**: Lists are not exhaustive; researchers may need to add domain-specific terms
5. **Context Sensitivity**: Keywords may have different meanings in different contexts

## Reproducibility

For research reproducibility:

1. **Export Your Keywords**: Use the export function to save the exact keywords used in your analysis
2. **Document Modifications**: Note any keywords you added, removed, or modified
3. **Version Control**: Record the Document Lens version used
4. **Cite This Document**: Reference this methodology document in your research

## Customization

Researchers are encouraged to:

1. **Review Keywords**: Examine lists before analysis to ensure relevance
2. **Add Custom Terms**: Include domain-specific or organization-specific terminology
3. **Remove Irrelevant Terms**: Exclude keywords not relevant to your research question
4. **Create Custom Lists**: Build entirely custom keyword lists for specialized research
