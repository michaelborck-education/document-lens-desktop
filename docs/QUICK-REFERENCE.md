## Research Themes

Each project has a theme that determines available keyword frameworks:

| Theme | Frameworks | Best For |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| **Sustainability** | TCFD, GRI, SDGs, SASB | ESG reports, climate disclosures |
| **Cybersecurity** | NIST CSF, ISO 27001, CIS, MITRE | Security audits, compliance |
| **Finance** | Financial Ratios, SEC, Basel III | Annual reports, filings |
| **Healthcare** | Clinical Trials, FDA, HIPAA | Medical research, compliance |

| **Academic** | Research Methods, Statistics, Literature | Papers, dissertations |
| **Project Mgmt** | Agile, PMBOK, Risk Management | Project documentation |
| **General** | None (custom only) | New domains, custom keywords |

**Tip**: Theme is set when creating a project. To change themes, create a new project and add documents from library.

## Common Questions

### Q: What's the difference between Quick Filter and Projects?

**Quick Filter** = Temporary, per-session filtering
- Select specific documents for analysis
- Not saved between sessions
- Good for ad-hoc exploration

**Projects** = Permanent organization
- Documents assigned to projects
- Saved to database
- Good for ongoing research

### Q: Can a document be in multiple projects?

Yes! Documents live in the central **Document Library** and can be added to any number of projects.

### Q: What's the difference between "Remove from Project" and "Delete from Library"?

- **Remove from Project**: Document stays in library, can be added to other projects
- **Delete from Library**: Permanently deletes document from everywhere

### Q: I have 50 PDFs to import. How long will it take?

About **1-2 seconds per PDF** (extraction). So 50 PDFs = 1-2 minutes.

### Q: Can I share my project with a colleague?

Yes! **Export → Bundle** (+ options) → Share the .lens file → They **Import Bundle**

### Q: What if my PDF has scanned images (not extractable text)?

Current version only works with PDFs that have extractable text.
Workaround: Use OCR tool first to create searchable PDF.

### Q: Can I have multiple active profiles?

No, only one profile is active per project.
But you can quickly switch by clicking a profile and making it active.

### Q: Can I change a project's theme after creating it?

No, themes are set at creation. To use a different theme:
1. Create a new project with the desired theme
2. Use "Add from Library" to add your existing documents
3. Your documents are now in both projects

### Q: How do I know if an update is available?

A notification appears in the sidebar when updates are available. If you don't see one, you're running the latest version.

### Q: How large can my project be?

Tested with 1000+ documents. Performance may slow with very large projects.
Use Quick Filter to subset documents during analysis for better performance.

## Error Messages & Solutions

| Error | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "No results found" | Verify keywords in profile, check Quick Filter settings, review original PDF |
| "PDF not available" | Check file path, re-import if missing |
| "Database locked" | Close other instances of app, restart |
| "Import failed" | Verify .lens file is valid, check disk space, restart app |

---

## Data Storage

### Where is my data stored?

**Local database**: `~/Library/Application Support/document-lens/document-lens.db` (Mac)

Or use Settings → Data Management → **Open Database Folder**

### What gets synced to cloud?

Nothing! All data stays on your machine.

### Can I backup my data?

Yes! Copy the database file. Or Export a .lens bundle.

### Can I migrate to another computer?

Yes! Copy the database file to new computer, or Export .lens + Import.

## Performance Tips

### Speed Up Large Projects

1. **Use Quick Filter**: Don't analyze all 1000 documents, filter to relevant subset
2. **Disable unused domains**: Fewer domains = faster analysis
3. **Limit keyword count**: 20 keywords searches faster than 200
4. **Clear cache**: Settings → Data Management → May help if running slow

### Reduce File Size When Exporting

1. Export without PDFs (often 80% of file size)
2. Export without extracted text (if not needed)
3. Exclude analysis results (regenerate on import)

## Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Use Quick Filter for Exploration
Before committing to analysis methodology, use Quick Filter to explore different document subsets quickly.

### Tip 2: Document Metadata
Add company name and year to documents - makes filtering and comparison much easier.

### Tip 3: View Stats for Outliers
Use "View Stats" to identify unusual documents (very long, very short, difficult to read) that might skew analysis.

### Tip 4: Export Patterns
- **Collaborate**: Export with Text, without PDFs
- **Backup**: Export with everything
- **Share settings**: Export Profiles only

### Tip 5: Pilot Approach
Before analyzing 500 documents:
1. Use Quick Filter to test with 10 docs
2. Verify results make sense
3. Scale to full dataset
